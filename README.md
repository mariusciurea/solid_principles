# SOLID Principles

- S - Single Responsibility
- O - Open Closed
- L - Liskov Substitution
- I - Interface Segregation
- D - Dependency Inversion

### Single Responsibility
 - Author: Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin)
 - Principle: A class should have only one reason to change - A class should have only 1 responsibility
 - Example [here](single_responsability.py)

### Open - Closed Principle
 - Author: Bertrand Meyer
 - Principle: Functions, classes, modules should be open for extension, but closed for modification
 - Example [here](open_closed.py)

### Liskov Substitution
 - Author: Barbara Liskov
 - Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
A child class must be substitutable for its parent class
 - Example [here](liskov_substitution.py)

### Interface Segregation Principle
 - Author: Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin)
 - Principle: Clients (subclasses) should not be forced to implement interfaces (methods) they do not use.
 - Example [here](interface_segregation.py)

### Dependency Inversion
 - Author: Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin)
 - Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions - The scope of this principle is to
eliminate the coupling
 - Example [here](dependency_inversion.py)
